## Abstract

STAB3L introduces a revolutionary approach to standardizing, verifying, and trading compute resources through blockchain technology. By tokenizing compute units (CUs) with cryptographic verification, STAB3L creates a transparent, efficient, and secure marketplace for compute power across multiple blockchain ecosystems.

## Problem Statement

The current compute resource market faces several challenges:

- **Lack of Standardization**: No universal standard for measuring and comparing compute resources
- **Verification Challenges**: Difficulty in verifying the actual capabilities of compute resources
- **Market Fragmentation**: Siloed marketplaces with limited liquidity and price discovery
- **Cross-Chain Limitations**: Inability to seamlessly trade compute resources across different blockchain ecosystems
- **Trust Issues**: Reliance on centralized intermediaries for verification and settlement

## Solution: The STAB3L Platform

STAB3L addresses these challenges through a comprehensive platform with several key components:

### 1. Compute Unit Standardization

STAB3L introduces a standardized Compute Unit (CU) that represents a quantifiable measure of computational power:

  <img src="https://quickchart.io/chart?c={type:'flowchart',data:{nodes:[{id:'A',text:'Raw Compute Resources'},{id:'B',text:'Benchmarking'},{id:'C',text:'Standardization Algorithm'},{id:'D',text:'CU Value Assignment'},{id:'E',text:'CU Token Creation'}],edges:[{from:'A',to:'B'},{from:'B',to:'C'},{from:'C',to:'D'},{from:'D',to:'E'}]}}" alt="Compute Unit Standardization Flow" />
</div>

The standardization process ensures that compute resources from different providers can be compared and traded on a level playing field.

### 2. Cryptographic Verification

STAB3L employs two primary verification methods:

{% tab title="Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)" %}
ZKPs allow providers to prove they have run benchmarks correctly without revealing underlying hardware details:

- **Privacy-Preserving**: Hardware details remain confidential
- **Cryptographically Secure**: Mathematical guarantees of correctness
- **Decentralized**: No trusted third party required
- **Efficient**: Compact proofs that can be verified quickly
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)" %}
TEEs provide a secure environment for running benchmarks:

- **Hardware-Level Security**: Isolated execution environment
- **Tamper-Resistant**: Protected from external interference
- **Remote Attestation**: Cryptographic verification of execution
- **Industry Standard**: Leverages established technologies like Intel SGX, AMD SEV
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### 3. Tokenization Architecture

CU tokens are implemented as ERC-1155 tokens with the following characteristics:

- **Multi-Token Standard**: Efficient handling of multiple token types
- **Batch Operations**: Reduced gas costs for multiple operations
- **Metadata Support**: Rich information about the underlying compute resources
- **Fractional Ownership**: Support for partial ownership of compute resources

### 4. Cross-Chain Bridge

The STAB3L Cross-Chain Bridge enables seamless transfer of CU tokens between different blockchain networks:

<div class="mermaid-wrapper">
  <img src="https://quickchart.io/chart?c={type:'sequence',data:{actors:['User','Source Chain','Relayers','Destination Chain'],actorKeys:['user','source','relayers','destination'],signals:[{message:'Lock CU tokens',from:'user',to:'source'},{message:'Emit LockEvent',from:'source',to:'source'},{message:'Monitor events',from:'source',to:'relayers',dashed:true},{message:'Confirm lock (multiple confirmations)',from:'relayers',to:'destination'},{message:'Verify confirmations',from:'destination',to:'destination'},{message:'Mint equivalent CU tokens',from:'destination',to:'user'}]}}" alt="Cross-Chain Bridge Flow" />
</div>

This creates a unified marketplace for compute resources across multiple blockchain ecosystems.

### 5. Marketplace

STAB3L provides a comprehensive marketplace for trading CU tokens:

- **Spot Market**: Immediate trading of CU tokens
- **Futures Market**: Trading contracts for future delivery of compute resources
- **Options Market**: Trading rights to buy or sell CU tokens at predetermined prices

## Technical Architecture

STAB3L employs a modular, layered architecture designed for security, scalability, and interoperability:

### Data Layer
- On-chain storage (Arbitrum, Solana) for CU data, collateral, and token balances
- IPFS for large datasets like benchmarks

### Business Logic Layer
- Smart contracts (Solidity) for minting, redemption, marketplace, and cross-chain logic
- Off-chain logic (Python/Rust) for ZKPs and pricing

### API Layer
- REST/gRPC APIs for provider compute delivery
- Hosted on Kubernetes clusters (AWS EKS) with load balancers

### Presentation Layer
- React frontend for users, with Web3 integration (Wagmi, MetaMask)

## Token Economics

STAB3L features a dual-token system:

<div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4">
  <div class="border rounded-lg p-4 hover:shadow-md transition-shadow">
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold">STAB3L Token (STAB3L)</h3>
    <p>The main utility token of the ecosystem</p>
    <p><strong>Total Supply:</strong> 10 billion tokens</p>
    <p><strong>Use Cases:</strong> Fee payments, staking, liquidity provision</p>
  </div>
  <div class="border rounded-lg p-4 hover:shadow-md transition-shadow">
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold">STB Governance Token (STB-GOV)</h3>
    <p>The governance and rewards token</p>
    <p><strong>Total Supply:</strong> 1 billion tokens</p>
    <p><strong>Use Cases:</strong> Governance voting, staking rewards, fee discounts</p>
  </div>
</div>

The token system is designed to create a balanced economic model that separates utility and governance functions, with mechanisms for value accrual and long-term sustainability.

## Security Measures

STAB3L implements comprehensive security measures:

### Smart Contract Security
- Formal verification of critical contracts
- Multi-signature governance (7/11)
- Circuit breakers for emergency situations
- Regular security audits

### Verification Security
- Zero-Knowledge Proofs for privacy-preserving verification
- Trusted Execution Environments for secure computation
- Multiple independent verifiers
- Cryptographic attestation

### Cross-Chain Security
- Multi-relayer consensus (minimum confirmations)
- Value limits to mitigate potential exploits
- Circuit breaker mechanism
- Real-time monitoring and alerts

## Governance

STAB3L is governed by its community through a decentralized governance system:

- **Proposal Creation**: Requires 1,000 STB-GOV tokens
- **Voting**: STB-GOV holders vote on proposals
- **Execution**: Approved proposals are implemented after a timelock period
- **Multi-Sig Oversight**: Critical parameters controlled by a 7/11 multi-signature wallet
