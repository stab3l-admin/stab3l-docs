# Security Guide

Security is a core principle of the STAB3L platform. This guide outlines the security measures implemented in the platform and provides best practices for users, providers, and developers.

{% hint style="info" %}
STAB3L undergoes regular security audits by independent third-party firms. Audit reports are available in the [Security section](https://stab3l.io/security) of our website.
{% endhint %}

## Platform Security Architecture

STAB3L implements a multi-layered security architecture to protect user assets, data, and the integrity of the platform.

### Smart Contract Security

The STAB3L smart contracts form the foundation of the platform's security:

1. **Formal Verification**: All critical smart contracts undergo formal verification to mathematically prove their correctness.

2. **Multi-signature Governance**: Contract upgrades require approval from 7 out of 11 governance signers with a 21-day timelock period.

3. **Circuit Breakers**: Automatic pause mechanisms are triggered if suspicious activity is detected, such as:
   - Unusual trading volume (>50% increase in 1 hour)
   - Large bridge transfers (>$1M equivalent)
   - Rapid price fluctuations (>20% in 1 hour)

4. **Access Control**: Granular role-based access control using OpenZeppelin's AccessControl library.

5. **Secure Randomness**: VRF (Verifiable Random Function) for any randomness requirements.

### Verification Security

The verification of compute resources is secured through:

1. **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP)**: Cryptographic proofs that verify compute resources without revealing sensitive information.

2. **Trusted Execution Environments (TEE)**: Secure enclaves that isolate computation from the host system.

3. **Attestation**: Remote attestation to verify the integrity of TEE environments.

4. **Benchmark Integrity**: Tamper-proof benchmarking processes with cryptographic verification.

### Cross-Chain Security

The cross-chain bridge implements multiple security measures:

1. **Message Verification**: Cryptographic verification of cross-chain messages.

2. **Confirmation Thresholds**: Minimum confirmation requirements before processing transactions.

3. **Value Limits**: Maximum transfer limits to mitigate the impact of potential exploits.

4. **Relayer Redundancy**: Multiple independent relayers to ensure availability and consensus.

5. **Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of bridge activity with automated alerts.

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Wallet Security" %}
1. **Use Hardware Wallets**: Store significant assets in hardware wallets like Ledger or Trezor.

2. **Separate Wallets**: Use different wallets for different purposes (trading, holding, etc.).

3. **Secure Recovery Phrases**: Store recovery phrases offline in secure, multiple locations.

4. **Check Transactions**: Always verify transaction details before signing.

5. **Use Multisig**: Consider using multisig wallets for large holdings.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Account Security" %}
1. **Strong Passwords**: Use unique, complex passwords for your STAB3L account.

2. **Two-Factor Authentication**: Enable 2FA using an authenticator app.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Check your account activity regularly.

4. **Authorized Devices**: Review and manage devices authorized to access your account.

5. **Phishing Awareness**: Be vigilant about phishing attempts and always verify URLs.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Transaction Security" %}
1. **Start Small**: Test new features with small amounts first.

2. **Set Limits**: Use transaction limits to minimize potential losses.

3. **Verify Addresses**: Double-check recipient addresses before confirming transactions.

4. **Gas Settings**: Understand gas settings to avoid transaction failures.

5. **Slippage Protection**: Set appropriate slippage tolerance for trades.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### For Providers

1. **Secure Infrastructure**: Implement robust security measures for your compute infrastructure:
   - Network segmentation
   - Firewall rules
   - Regular security updates
   - Intrusion detection systems

2. **Key Management**: Secure management of private keys:
   - Hardware security modules (HSMs)
   - Key rotation policies
   - Principle of least privilege

3. **Monitoring and Alerting**: Implement comprehensive monitoring:
   - Resource utilization
   - Unusual access patterns
   - System integrity
   - Automated alerts for anomalies

4. **Backup and Recovery**: Regular backups and tested recovery procedures:
   - Offsite backups
   - Encrypted backups
   - Regular recovery testing

5. **Compliance**: Adhere to relevant security standards and regulations:
   - ISO 27001
   - SOC 2
   - GDPR (if applicable)

### For Developers

1. **Secure Development Lifecycle**:
   - Threat modeling
   - Security requirements
   - Code reviews
   - Security testing
   - Vulnerability management

2. **API Security**:
   - TLS encryption
   - API key rotation
   - Rate limiting
   - Input validation
   - Output encoding

3. **Smart Contract Development**:
   - Follow established patterns
   - Use audited libraries (OpenZeppelin)
   - Comprehensive testing
   - Gas optimization without security compromises
   - Formal verification when possible

4. **Dependency Management**:
   - Regular dependency updates
   - Vulnerability scanning
   - Dependency pinning
   - Software composition analysis

## Security Incident Response

STAB3L has a comprehensive security incident response plan:

### Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it through our [Security Bug Bounty Program](https://hackerone.com/stab3l) or email [security@stab3l.io](mailto:security@stab3l.io).

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please do not disclose security vulnerabilities publicly until they have been addressed by the STAB3L team.
{% endhint %}

### Incident Response Process

1. **Detection and Reporting**: Security incidents can be detected through monitoring systems or reported by users, providers, or security researchers.

2. **Assessment and Triage**: The security team assesses the severity and impact of the incident.

3. **Containment**: Immediate actions to contain the incident, which may include:
   - Pausing affected contracts
   - Restricting access to affected systems
   - Isolating compromised components

4. **Eradication**: Removing the cause of the incident and addressing vulnerabilities.

5. **Recovery**: Restoring systems to normal operation.

6. **Post-Incident Analysis**: Comprehensive review to prevent similar incidents.

7. **Disclosure**: Transparent communication about the incident, impact, and remediation.

## Security Audits and Compliance
