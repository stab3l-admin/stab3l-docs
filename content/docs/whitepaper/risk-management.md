# 7. Risk Management for Compute Providers

Compute providers face significant risks, including impermanent loss (IL), price volatility, and operational disruptions, which could deter participation in STAB3L's staking ecosystem. This section outlines a comprehensive risk management framework, including mathematical models, insurance mechanisms, hedging tools, and withdrawal safeguards, to ensure provider confidence and ecosystem stability.

## 7.1 Risk Categories for Compute Providers

Compute providers staking CUs to mint CU tokens and earn rSTB face:

- **Impermanent Loss (IL)**: Losses from price volatility in liquidity pools (e.g., sSTB/USDC).
- **Price Volatility Risk**: Fluctuations in $P_{rSTB}$ and $P_{sSTB}$ impacting rewards and collateral value.
- **Operational Risks**: Hardware failures, energy disruptions, or hacks affecting CU availability.
- **Mass Unstaking Risk**: Sudden withdrawals destabilizing the peg and reducing liquidity.

STAB3L mitigates these risks through insurance, hedging, and governance mechanisms, detailed below.

## 7.2 Impermanent Loss Insurance

Liquidity providers (LPs) and compute providers staking in pools face IL, calculated as:

$$
IL = \frac{2 \cdot \sqrt{r}}{(1+r)} - 1
$$

Where ${r}$ is the ratio of the post-deposit price to the initial price of the paired asset (e.g., $P_{sSTB}/P_{USDC}$). For example, if $P_{sSTB}$ drops from 0.06 to 0.05 while $P_{USDC}$ remains 1 USD:

$$
r = 0.05/1 = 0.05
$$

$$
IL = \frac{2 \cdot \sqrt{0.05}}{(1+0.05)} - 1 \approx \frac{2 \cdot 0.2236}{1.05} - 1 \approx 0.426 - 1 = -0.574 \text{ (57.4\% loss)}
$$

STAB3L offers IL insurance:

- **Coverage**: Up to 80% of IL for LPs holding positions >90 days, funded by a 1% fee on protocol transactions (e.g., staking, trading), growing the Insurance Fund to 50M USD over 5 years.
- **Payout Formula**:
  $$
  \text{Compensation} = 0.8 \cdot IL \cdot V_{staked}
  $$
  
  Where:
  
  - $V_{staked}$ is the value of staked assets (e.g., 1M sSTB). 
  
  For:
  
  - ${IL} = -0.574$ and $V_{staked} = 1M$ (1 million USD):
  
  $$
  \text{Compensation} = 0.8 \cdot (-0.574) \cdot 1,000,000 \approx 459,200
  $$
  (approximately 459,200 USD)

- **Claim Process**: Automated via smart contracts, with a 7-day verification period to prevent fraud. Claims >100,000 sSTB require governance approval.

## 7.3 Price Volatility Hedging

Compute providers can hedge against $P_{rSTB}$ and $P_{sSTB}$ volatility:

- **rSTB Price Protection**: Providers earn a minimum 5% APR in rSTB regardless of price fluctuations, with additional rewards if $P_{rSTB}$ appreciates >10% annually.
- **sSTB Peg Insurance**: If $P_{sSTB}$ deviates >5% from 0.06 USD for >24 hours, providers receive compensation from the Stability Fund:
  $$
  \text{Compensation} = V_{staked} \cdot \min(0.05, |P_{sSTB} - 0.06|/0.06)
  $$
 
  For:
  
  - $V_{staked} = 1M$ (1 million USD) and;
  - $P_{sSTB} = 0.05$ (16.7% deviation):
 
  $$
  \text{Compensation} = 1,000,000 \cdot \min(0.05, 0.167) = 50,000
  $$
  (approximately 50,000 USD)

- **Options Contracts**: Providers can purchase put options on rSTB (e.g., strike price at 90% of current $P_{rSTB}$) for 2% of position value, protecting against significant downside.

## 7.4 Operational Risk Mitigation

STAB3L implements safeguards against operational failures:

- **Redundancy Requirements**: Providers must maintain N+1 redundancy (e.g., 11 servers for 10 CUs), verified via periodic benchmarks.
- **Uptime Insurance**: Providers with >99.9% uptime receive a 2% APR bonus in rSTB, while those with <98% face penalties:
  $$
  \text{Penalty} = V_{staked} \cdot (0.98 - \text{Uptime}) \cdot 10
  $$
  
  For:
  
  - $V_{staked} = 1M$ (1 million USD) and 97% uptime:

  $$
  \text{Penalty} = 1,000,000 \cdot (0.98 - 0.97) \cdot 10 = 10,000
  $$
  (approximately 10,000 USD)

- **Security Audits**: Mandatory quarterly security audits, with providers receiving a security score (0-100) affecting insurance premiums:
  $$
  \text{Premium} = \text{Base Premium} \cdot (1 - \text{Security Score}/200)
  $$
  
  For a base premium of 2% and a security score of 80:
  
  $$
  \text{Premium} = 2\% \cdot (1 - 80/200) = 2\% \cdot 0.6 = 1.2\%
  $$

## 7.5 Withdrawal Safeguards

To prevent mass unstaking and maintain peg stability:

- **Tiered Withdrawal Limits**: Daily withdrawal caps based on total staked CUs:
  $$
  \text{Daily Limit} = \min(0.05 \cdot \text{Total Staked CUs}, \text{10,000 CUs})
  $$
 
  For 1M staked CUs, the daily limit is 50,000 CUs.

- **Dynamic Withdrawal Fees**: Fees increase with withdrawal size to discourage large unstaking:
  $$
  \text{Fee} = \text{Base Fee} + \alpha \cdot (\text{Withdrawal Size}/\text{Total Staked CUs})
  $$
  
  Where:
  
  - $\text{Base Fee} = 1\%$ and; 
  - $\alpha = 0.5$. For a 50,000 CU withdrawal from 1M staked CUs:
  
  $$
  \text{Fee} = 1\% + 0.5 \cdot (50,000/1,000,000) = 1\% + 0.5 \cdot 0.05 = 1\% + 0.025 = 3.5\%
  $$

- **Emergency Circuit Breakers**: Governance can pause withdrawals for up to 72 hours if $P_{sSTB}$ deviates >10% or if >10% of CUs are unstaked in 24 hours.

## 7.6 Risk Simulation and Stress Testing

STAB3L validates risk management via Monte Carlo simulation:

- **Parameters**: $P_{CU} \sim LogNormal(\ln(0.06), 0.3)$, $P_{rSTB} \sim LogNormal(\ln(1), 0.5)$, uptime $\sim Beta(9, 1)$, withdrawal rate $\sim Exponential(0.01)$.
- **Iterations**: 10,000 runs over 12 months, computing provider profitability with and without risk management.
- **Results**: Without risk management, 15% of providers face >20% losses; with risk management, <1% face such losses, with 95% maintaining profitability even in extreme scenarios (e.g., $P_{CU}$ drops to 0.04 USD, 5% of CUs unstaked in 1 day).

## 7.7 Graph Description

## 7.8 Practical Considerations

- **Insurance Fund Growth**: Launch with 10M USD seed funding, growing to 50M USD within 5 years via the 1% transaction fee.
- **Governance Oversight**: Quarterly risk committee reviews, with rSTB holders voting on parameter adjustments (e.g., coverage limits, premium rates).
- **Provider Education**: Mandatory risk management training and certification for providers staking >10,000 CUs, ensuring understanding of hedging tools and insurance mechanisms.
