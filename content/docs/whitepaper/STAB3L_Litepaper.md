</div>

Our platform solves critical challenges in the current compute resource market, including lack of standardization, verification difficulties, market fragmentation, cross-chain limitations, and trust issues. STAB3L's approach combines advanced zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), trusted execution environments (TEEs), and a dual-token economic model to create a paradigm shift in how compute resources are allocated, verified, and traded.

With a total addressable market projected to reach $1 trillion by 2030 and an experienced team from leading technology and blockchain companies, STAB3L is positioned to become the foundation for the future of decentralized compute infrastructure.

## Problem Statement

{% accordion title="The Current Compute Resource Market Challenges" %}
The current compute resource market faces five critical challenges that STAB3L addresses:

1. **Lack of Standardization**: No universal standard exists for measuring and comparing compute resources, making it difficult for users to make informed decisions.

2. **Verification Challenges**: Users struggle to verify the actual capabilities of compute resources, leading to mistrust and inefficient resource allocation.

3. **Market Fragmentation**: Compute resources are traded in siloed marketplaces with limited liquidity and price discovery, resulting in inefficient markets.

4. **Cross-Chain Limitations**: There's no seamless way to trade compute resources across different blockchain ecosystems, restricting market efficiency.

5. **Trust Issues**: The market relies heavily on centralized intermediaries for verification and settlement, introducing single points of failure and trust concerns.
{% endaccordion %}

These challenges create significant friction in the market, limiting growth and innovation in the broader blockchain and AI ecosystems.

</div>

## The STAB3L Solution

STAB3L addresses these challenges through a comprehensive platform with five key components:

### 1. Compute Unit Standardization

STAB3L introduces a standardized Compute Unit (CU) representing a quantifiable measure of computational power. The standardization process involves benchmarking raw compute resources, applying our proprietary standardization algorithm, and assigning CU values.

The mathematical foundation of our CU standardization is expressed as:

$$
CU = \alpha \cdot \text{FLOPS} + \beta \cdot \text{MEM} + \gamma \cdot \text{STORAGE} + \delta \cdot \text{NETWORK}
$$

Where:
- $\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta$ are weighting coefficients
- FLOPS = Floating Point Operations Per Second
- MEM = Memory bandwidth and capacity
- STORAGE = Storage capacity and I/O performance
- NETWORK = Network throughput and latency

<div class="mermaid-wrapper">
  <img src="https://quickchart.io/chart?c={type:'flowchart',data:{nodes:[{id:'A',text:'Raw Compute Resources'},{id:'B',text:'Benchmarking'},{id:'C',text:'Standardization Algorithm'},{id:'D',text:'CU Value Assignment'},{id:'E',text:'CU Token Creation'}],edges:[{from:'A',to:'B'},{from:'B',to:'C'},{from:'C',to:'D'},{from:'D',to:'E'}]}}" alt="Compute Unit Standardization Flow" />
</div>

This ensures that compute resources from different providers can be compared and traded fairly.

### 2. Cryptographic Verification

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)" %}
ZKPs allow providers to prove they have run benchmarks correctly without revealing underlying hardware details:

The ZK-proof system uses the following verification equation:

$$
\text{Verify}(\pi, x, y) = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } \pi \text{ is valid for statement } (x, y) \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

Where:
- $\pi$ is the proof
- $x$ is the public input (benchmark requirements)
- $y$ is the public output (CU value)

**Benefits:**
- **Privacy-Preserving**: Hardware details remain confidential
- **Cryptographically Secure**: Mathematical guarantees of correctness
- **Decentralized**: No trusted third party required
- **Efficient**: Compact proofs that can be verified quickly
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)" %}
TEEs provide a secure environment for running benchmarks:

The security model for TEEs can be represented as:

$$
\mathcal{E}_{\text{TEE}}(f, x) \rightarrow (y, \sigma)
$$

Where:
- $f$ is the benchmark function
- $x$ is the input data
- $y$ is the output result
- $\sigma$ is the cryptographic attestation

**Benefits:**
- **Hardware-Level Security**: Isolated execution environment
- **Tamper-Resistant**: Protected from external interference
- **Remote Attestation**: Cryptographic verification of execution
- **Industry Standard**: Leverages established technologies like Intel SGX, AMD SEV
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### 3. Tokenization Architecture

CU tokens are implemented as ERC-1155 tokens with the following mathematical model:

$$
\text{Balance}(a, i) = \sum_{j=1}^{n} \text{Transfer}(a, i, j)
$$

Where:
- $a$ is the account address
- $i$ is the token ID
- $\text{Transfer}(a, i, j)$ represents the net transfer amount of token $i$ to address $a$ in transaction $j$

Key features include:
- Multi-token support for efficient handling of multiple token types
- Batch operations to reduce gas costs
- Metadata support for rich information about underlying compute resources
- Fractional ownership support

### 4. Cross-Chain Bridge

The STAB3L Cross-Chain Bridge enables seamless transfer of CU tokens between different blockchain networks, creating a unified marketplace across multiple ecosystems.

{% accordion title="Bridge Security Model" %}
The security of our cross-chain bridge is ensured through a multi-signature threshold scheme:

$$
\text{Verify}(m, \{s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_k\}) = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } \sum_{i=1}^{k} \text{Valid}(m, s_i) \geq t \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

Where:
- $m$ is the message (token transfer)
- $s_i$ are the signatures from relayers
- $\text{Valid}(m, s_i)$ validates signature $s_i$ on message $m$
- $t$ is the threshold (e.g., 7 out of 11 signatures required)

This ensures that bridge operations are secure against individual relayer failures or compromises.
{% endaccordion %}

<div class="mermaid-wrapper">
  <img src="https://quickchart.io/chart?c={type:'sequence',data:{actors:['User','Source Chain','Relayers','Destination Chain'],actorKeys:['user','source','relayers','destination'],signals:[{message:'Lock CU tokens',from:'user',to:'source'},{message:'Emit LockEvent',from:'source',to:'source'},{message:'Monitor events',from:'source',to:'relayers',dashed:true},{message:'Confirm lock (multiple confirmations)',from:'relayers',to:'destination'},{message:'Verify confirmations',from:'destination',to:'destination'},{message:'Mint equivalent CU tokens',from:'destination',to:'user'}]}}" alt="Cross-Chain Bridge Flow" />
</div>

### 5. Comprehensive Marketplace

Our platform offers multiple markets for trading CU tokens:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Spot Market" %}
The spot market provides immediate trading of CU tokens with a standard order book model:

$$
P_{execute} = \begin{cases}
P_{bid} & \text{for market sell orders} \\
P_{ask} & \text{for market buy orders}
\end{cases}
$$

Liquidity is enhanced through automated market makers (AMMs) with the constant product formula:

$$
x \cdot y = k
$$

Where:
- $x$ is the quantity of CU tokens
- $y$ is the quantity of stable tokens
- $k$ is a constant (liquidity)
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Futures Market" %}
The futures market allows trading of standardized contracts for future delivery of compute resources:

$$
F_t = S_t \cdot e^{(r+c-y)(T-t)}
$$

Where:
- $F_t$ is the futures price at time $t$
- $S_t$ is the spot price at time $t$
- $r$ is the risk-free rate
- $c$ is the cost of carry
- $y$ is the convenience yield
- $T$ is the expiration date
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Options Market" %}
The options market enables trading rights (but not obligations) to buy or sell CU tokens at predetermined prices:

For call options, the Black-Scholes pricing model is adapted:

$$
C = S \cdot N(d_1) - K \cdot e^{-r(T-t)} \cdot N(d_2)
$$

Where:
- $C$ is the call option price
- $S$ is the current CU token price
- $K$ is the strike price
- $r$ is the risk-free rate
- $T-t$ is time to expiration
- $N(\cdot)$ is the cumulative distribution function of standard normal distribution
- $d_1 = \frac{\ln(S/K) + (r + \sigma^2/2)(T-t)}{\sigma\sqrt{T-t}}$
- $d_2 = d_1 - \sigma\sqrt{T-t}$
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Technical Architecture

STAB3L employs a modular, layered architecture designed for security, scalability, and interoperability:

<div class="mermaid-wrapper">
  <img src="https://quickchart.io/chart?c={type:'sankey',data:{datasets:[{data:[{from:'Data Layer',to:'Business Logic Layer',flow:1},{from:'Business Logic Layer',to:'API Layer',flow:1},{from:'API Layer',to:'Presentation Layer',flow:1},{from:'On-chain Storage',to:'Data Layer',flow:0.6},{from:'IPFS Storage',to:'Data Layer',flow:0.4},{from:'Smart Contracts',to:'Business Logic Layer',flow:0.5},{from:'Off-chain Logic',to:'Business Logic Layer',flow:0.5},{from:'REST/gRPC APIs',to:'API Layer',flow:0.7},{from:'Kubernetes',to:'API Layer',flow:0.3},{from:'React Frontend',to:'Presentation Layer',flow:0.6},{from:'Web3 Integration',to:'Presentation Layer',flow:0.4}]}]}}" alt="STAB3L Architecture Flow" />
</div>

{% accordion title="Architecture Layer Details" %}
### Data Layer
- On-chain storage (Arbitrum, Solana) for CU data, collateral, and token balances
- IPFS for large datasets like benchmarks

### Business Logic Layer
- Smart contracts (Solidity) for minting, redemption, marketplace, and cross-chain logic
- Off-chain logic (Python/Rust) for ZKPs and pricing

### API Layer
- REST/gRPC APIs for provider compute delivery
- Hosted on Kubernetes clusters (AWS EKS) with load balancers

### Presentation Layer
- React frontend with Web3 integration (Wagmi, MetaMask)
{% endaccordion %}

The system's performance can be modeled using queuing theory:

$$
L = \lambda W
$$

Where:
- $L$ is the average number of requests in the system
- $\lambda$ is the average arrival rate of new requests
- $W$ is the average time spent in the system

## Token Economics

STAB3L's dual-token system separates utility and governance functions, creating a balanced economic model:

<div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4">
  <div class="border rounded-lg p-4 hover:shadow-md transition-shadow">
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold">sSTB Token (sSTB)</h3>
    <p>The main utility token of the ecosystem</p>
    <p><strong>Total Supply:</strong> 10 billion tokens</p>
    <p><strong>Use Cases:</strong> Fee payments, staking, liquidity provision</p>
  </div>
  <div class="border rounded-lg p-4 hover:shadow-md transition-shadow">
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold">STB Governance Token (rSTB)</h3>
    <p>The governance and rewards token</p>
    <p><strong>Total Supply:</strong> 1 billion tokens</p>
    <p><strong>Use Cases:</strong> Governance voting, staking rewards, fee discounts</p>
  </div>
</div>

### Token Distribution

<div class="pie-chart">
  <img src="https://quickchart.io/chart?c=%7Btype%3A%27pie%27%2Cdata%3A%7Blabels%3A%5B%27Community+%26+Ecosystem%27%2C%27Treasury%27%2C%27Team+%26+Advisors%27%2C%27Investors%27%2C%27Liquidity+Mining%27%5D%2Cdatasets%3A%5B%7Bdata%3A%5B40%2C25%2C15%2C15%2C5%5D%2CbackgroundColor%3A%5B%27%23FF6384%27%2C%27%2336A2EB%27%2C%27%23FFCE56%27%2C%27%234BC0C0%27%2C%27%239966FF%27%5D%7D%5D%7D%7D" alt="sSTB Token Distribution" />
</div>

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="sSTB Distribution" %}
| Allocation | Percentage | Amount | Vesting |
|------------|------------|--------|---------|
| Community & Ecosystem | 40% | 4 billion | 4-year linear vesting |
| Treasury | 25% | 2.5 billion | Controlled by governance |
| Team & Advisors | 15% | 1.5 billion | 1-year cliff, 3-year linear vesting |
| Investors | 15% | 1.5 billion | 6-month cliff, 2-year linear vesting |
| Liquidity Mining | 5% | 0.5 billion | Released over 4 years |
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="rSTB Distribution" %}
| Allocation | Percentage | Amount | Vesting |
|------------|------------|--------|---------|
| Community | 40% | 400 million | Released through staking rewards |
| Team | 20% | 200 million | 1-year cliff, 4-year linear vesting |
| Treasury | 20% | 200 million | Controlled by governance |
| Investors | 15% | 150 million | 6-month cliff, 2-year linear vesting |
| Advisors | 5% | 50 million | 6-month cliff, 2-year linear vesting |
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Value Accrual Mechanisms

Both tokens include deflationary mechanisms, with token supply dynamics modeled as:

$$
S_t = S_0 - \int_0^t B(\tau) \, d\tau + \int_0^t M(\tau) \, d\tau
$$

Where:
- $S_t$ is the token supply at time $t$
- $S_0$ is the initial token supply
- $B(\tau)$ is the burn rate at time $\tau$
- $M(\tau)$ is the minting rate at time $\tau$

Key mechanisms include:
- 10% of all fees collected in sSTB are burned
- 5% of all rSTB rewards distributed are burned
- Treasury buybacks and staking incentives reduce circulating supply

### Staking Programs

Multiple staking programs drive token utility with the following expected yields:

- **Incentive Programs**: Launch Early Adopter Bonus (15% APR on staking) to attract initial 50,000 users
- **Fee Subsidies**: Subsidize 50% of on-ramp fees to lower entry barriers

The cost per user acquisition (CAC) in Phase 1 is modeled as:

$$
\text{CAC}_1 = \frac{I_p + F_s}{U_1}
$$

Where:
- $I_p$ is the incentive program cost
- $F_s$ is the fee subsidy cost
- $U_1$ is the number of users acquired in Phase 1
{% endtab %}
