# Technical Architecture

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the STAB3L platform's technical architecture, including its components, interactions, and design principles.

{% hint style="info" %}
This documentation is intended for developers and technical users who want to understand the inner workings of the STAB3L platform.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important**: CU tokens are NOT tradable assets. They are temporary tokens that are burned immediately when exchanged for sSTB. This burning mechanism is crucial for maintaining the peg and ensuring that each sSTB is backed by real compute resources.
{% endhint %}

## Architecture Overview

STAB3L employs a modular, layered architecture designed for security, scalability, and interoperability:

![STAB3L Architecture Overview](https://stab3l.com/images/architecture-overview.png)

### Key Components

1. **Smart Contracts**: Core blockchain logic for compute resource verification, sSTB minting, marketplace, and governance
2. **Verification System**: ZKP and TEE-based verification of compute resources
3. **Cross-Chain Bridge**: Secure transfer of sSTB tokens between supported blockchains
4. **API Layer**: RESTful and GraphQL APIs for platform interaction
5. **Frontend Applications**: Web and mobile interfaces for users and providers

## Data Layer

The data layer manages the storage and persistence of platform data:

### On-Chain Storage

- **Primary Chain**: Arbitrum for main contract deployment and data storage
- **Secondary Chains**: Ethereum (for critical data), Solana, and other supported chains
- **Storage Optimization**: Minimized on-chain storage using event logs and IPFS for large datasets

### Off-Chain Storage

- **IPFS**: Decentralized storage for benchmark results, verification proofs, and metadata
- **TheGraph**: Indexing of on-chain events for efficient querying
- **Provider Database**: Secure storage of provider-specific data

## Smart Contract Architecture

The smart contract architecture follows a modular design pattern, with clear separation of concerns to enhance security, maintainability, and upgradability:

</div>

#### Key Contract Interactions Explained

1. **Verification and Minting Flow**:
   - Provider submits compute resources for verification through `ComputeUnitVerifier.sol`
   - Verification is performed using ZKP or TEE (see [Verification System](/docs/verification-system) for details)
   - Upon successful verification, `MintingAgent.sol` mints temporary CU tokens
   - CU tokens are immediately exchanged 1:1 for sSTB tokens and burned
   - The mathematical model for this exchange follows: $CU_{tokens} \rightarrow sSTB_{tokens}$ with a 1:1 ratio

2. **Staking and Rewards Flow**:
   - Provider stakes sSTB tokens through `ProviderStaking.sol` for a minimum of 7 days
   - Provider's collateral (minimum 120% of CU value) is locked in `CollateralManager.sol`
   - `RewardsDistributor.sol` calculates and distributes rSTB rewards based on:
     $R = S \times T \times M$
     where $R$ is the reward amount, $S$ is the staked amount, $T$ is the time staked, and $M$ is the reward multiplier

3. **Redemption Flow**:
   - User redeems sSTB tokens through `Redemption.sol`
   - sSTB tokens are burned, reducing the total supply
   - Provider is notified to deliver the compute resources
   - Upon confirmation, a portion of the provider's collateral is released

4. **Cross-Chain Bridge Flow**:
   - User initiates a bridge transaction through `CrossChainBridge.sol`
   - sSTB tokens are locked or burned on the source chain
   - `MessageVerifier.sol` verifies the cross-chain message
   - sSTB tokens are minted on the destination chain

For a more detailed explanation of the mathematical models underlying these interactions, see the [System Architecture & Mathematical Model](/docs/whitepaper/system-architecture) section of the whitepaper.

### Peg Stability Mechanism

The stability of the sSTB token is maintained through a combination of arbitrage, derivatives, and governance mechanisms, as defined by the peg stabilization equation:

$$
P_{sSTB} = P_{CU} + \Delta_{arbitrage} + \Delta_{derivatives} + \Delta_{governance}
$$

Where:
- $P_{CU}$ is the market price of 1 CU in USD (nominally $0.06, ±30% volatility)
- $P_{sSTB}$ is the target price of sSTB, fixed at $0.06 (1 CU)
- $\Delta_{arbitrage} = k \cdot (P_{sSTB} - P_{CU})$, with $k$ (arbitrage efficiency) dynamically adjustable via governance
- $\Delta_{derivatives} = m \cdot (P_{sSTB,futures} - P_{sSTB,spot})$, with $m$ (derivative market efficiency) adjustable
- $\Delta_{governance} = g \cdot (R_{actual} - R_{target})$, with $g$ (governance response factor) adjustable

This mechanism is implemented across multiple contracts:
- `SpotMarket.sol`, `FuturesMarket.sol`, and `OptionsMarket.sol` facilitate arbitrage and derivatives
- `Governance.sol` enables parameter adjustments through voting
- `Oracle.sol` provides price feeds for the calculation

For a complete derivation of this equation and simulation results, see the [System Architecture & Mathematical Model](/docs/whitepaper/system-architecture) section of the whitepaper.
{% endhint %}

## Verification System

The verification system ensures the authenticity of compute resources:

### Verification Process

1. **Provider Registration**: Provider registers and selects verification method
2. **Staking Period Selection**: Provider chooses staking period (minimum 7 days)
3. **Collateral Deposit**: Provider deposits collateral (minimum 120% of CU value)
4. **Benchmark Execution**: Provider runs standardized benchmarks
5. **Proof Generation**: ZKP or TEE generates cryptographic proof
6. **On-chain Verification**: Smart contracts verify the proof
7. **CU Value Assignment**: Standardized CU value assigned (1 CU = 10^15 FLOPs, $0.06)
8. **CU Token Minting**: Temporary CU tokens minted
9. **Immediate Exchange**: CU tokens immediately exchanged for sSTB
10. **CU Token Burning**: CU tokens burned upon exchange
11. **sSTB Staking**: sSTB automatically staked for chosen period
12. **rSTB Rewards**: Provider earns rSTB rewards throughout staking period

{% hint style="info" %}
The definition and value of 1 CU will be reviewed and potentially adjusted quarterly by the DAO through governance voting to ensure the CU standard remains relevant as compute technology evolves.
{% endhint %}
